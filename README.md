A [Marabu](https://marabu.dev/) blockchain node in Java written by Angel Le√≥n

Marabu is an academic blockchain spec meant to teach graduate level students how blockchains actually work.

We explore proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, transactions in the UTXO and accounts model, authenticated data structures such as Merkle Trees, simple payment verification, smart contracts, and their programming. A central topic of the course is understanding why blockchains are secure. We treat the question in theoretical depth using the cryptographic backbone model
